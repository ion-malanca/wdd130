        <p>Hello! My name is Ion Malanca, and I am from Moldova. I'm a big Formula 1
        fan, I enjoy watching the races and when I have the opportunity try and go in
        person. I like traveling as well, so far I have visited 25 countries, but hopefully
        more to come. I'm very excited about this class and to learn how to build websites!</p>

        <p>Moldova is a small country in Eastern Europe, located between Romania and Ukraine. 
        It is known for its rich cultural traditions, fertile farmland, and long history of wine making. 
        Moldova blends Eastern and Western influences, with a strong sense of national identity and a 
        growing focus on European integration.</p>
